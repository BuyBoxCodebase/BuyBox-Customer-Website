      <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>BuyBox</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”). These Customer Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the BuyBox website, mobile application, and related services (together, the “Platform”). By accessing or using the Platform you agree to these Terms and our <a href="/privacy" className="underline text-blue-700">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.</p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">1. Your BuyBox Account</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>You must create a BuyBox account to shop on the Platform.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials (username, password, phone number) confidential and for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>

      </ul>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">2. Shopping on BuyBox</h2>
      <p>When you place an order on BuyBox, you are buying directly from an independent seller. BuyBox acts as a facilitator that connects buyers and sellers and provides the Platform for listings, order placement, and communication.</p>
      <p>Product information, availability, pricing, and estimated delivery times are provided by sellers. BuyBox does not manufacture, own, or warrant the quality of sellers’ products.</p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">3. Prices and Payments</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>All prices are shown in the local currency unless otherwise indicated.</li>
        <li>Sellers may update prices at any time prior to your placing an order.</li>
        <li>Payment is processed through third-party payment providers integrated with BuyBox. We do not store full card or bank details.</li>
        <li>Taxes, fees, and delivery charges (if any) will be displayed at checkout before you confirm your order.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900">4. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>Sellers are responsible for packaging and shipping products to the delivery address you provide.</li>
        <li>Delivery times are estimates and may vary due to location, logistics, customs (for international orders), or other factors.</li>
        <li>Risk of loss transfers to you when the product is delivered to the specified address.</li>
        <li>BuyBox is not liable for shipping delays, loss, or damage that occurs during transit, except to the extent required by applicable law.</li>

      <p>Return and refund policies are determined by individual sellers. Before purchasing, please review the seller’s return policy displayed on the listing.</p>
      <p>If you have a problem with an order, contact BuyBox Customer Support and we will assist in facilitating resolution between you and the seller. While we will use reasonable efforts to help, BuyBox is not required to provide refunds directly unless applicable law requires it.</p>
